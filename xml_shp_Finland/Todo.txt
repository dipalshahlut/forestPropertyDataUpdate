Barkbeetle infestation detection using the sentinel-2 imagery applying machine learning (ML) approach: Primarily we created training data to differentiate the infested and healthy tree. Next, ML models were applied to identify barkbeetle infested regions. 
 
Forest clearcut Vs forest thinning (as a part of forest management) practice using the sentinel-2 imagery applying machine learning (ML) approach.
 
Tree species identification using the LiDAR inventory data applying machine learning (ML) approach. We used forest field measurement as a ground truth and used LiDAR data based machine learning (ML) approach to identify various tree species.
 
Forest property data update and automatize various steps involved in processing.
